# SlimeSaladGamelistScrape
Scrapes the Slime Salad Gamelist. 
Python 3. 

Requires selenium and Chromedriver.

Simply py gamelistscrape.py to run. Will print a list in console output. Pipe to a file if you want it saved. 

Will give you a list of URLs and Game names. Stops once it runs into the same game URL twice (I.E, once it stops paginating around 600-700 games currently).
